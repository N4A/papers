LBSN does not only mean adding a location information to traditional Social Network, but also consists of new social structure made up of individuals connected by the interdependency derived from their locations
in the physical world. All the information is simply classified as follows:

1. Social network: friends, groups.
2. Social structure can share location-embedded information
3. New social structure made up of individuals connected by the interdependency derived from their locations in the physical
4. Location-tagged media content, such as photos, video, and text

The following part will introduce some works in LBSN

Tobler’s First Law:  Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant thing.

1. users prefer to visit nearby POIs rather than distant ones;
2. users may be interested in POIs surrounded a POI that users prefer.
