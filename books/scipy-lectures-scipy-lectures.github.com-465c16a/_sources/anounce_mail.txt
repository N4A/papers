We have just released a new version of the "scipy lecture notes":
http://www.scipy-lectures.org/

These are a consistent set of material to learn the core aspects of the
scientific Python ecosystem, from beginner to expert. They are written
and maintained by a set of volunteers and published under a CC-BY
license.

Highlights of the latest version includes:

 * a chapter giving a introduction to statistics in Python
 * a new layout with emphasis on readability including on small devices
 * fully doctesting for Python 2 and 3 compatibility

We hope that you will find these notes useful, for you, your colleagues,
or your students.
