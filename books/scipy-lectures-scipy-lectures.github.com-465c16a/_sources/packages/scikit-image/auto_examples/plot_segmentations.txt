Watershed and random walker for segmentation
============================================

This example compares two segmentation methods in order to separate two
connected disks: the watershed algorithm, and the random walker algorithm.

Both segmentation methods require seeds, that are pixels belonging
unambigusouly to a reagion. Here, local maxima of the distance map to the
background are used as seeds.
